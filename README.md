## Introduction

Employee attrition refers to an employee’s voluntary
or involuntary resignation from a workforce. Organizations spend many resources in hiring talented employees
and training them. Every employee is critical to a company’s success. Our goal was to predict employee attrition
and identify the factors contributing to an employee leaving a workforce. We trained various classification models on our dataset and assessed their performance using different metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall and F1 Score. We
also analyzed the dataset to identify key factors contributing
to an employee leaving a workforce. Our project will assist organizations in gaining fresh insights into what drives
attrition and thus enhance retention rate.

## Methodology

## Dataset
We used the [IBM Employee Attrition dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset). It contains 35 columns and 1470 rows and has a mix of
numerical and categorical features. A sample row is shown below.
